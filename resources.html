        <p>This page could include a bunch of resources - either national resources or broken down by state
            we could include local orgs, linking to them and maybe include their city and phone number in case 
            users don't want to go to a website in order to limit their browser history.

            Might also want to include an alert that states if they are in immediate danger to call 911
