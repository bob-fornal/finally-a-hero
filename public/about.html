        <p>This page would include part of Michelle's story and why she created Love Me Like a Princess/Finally A Hero.
            We would include the mission and explain the origizations goals. Maybe highlight a link for submitting your own story.
            I believe the submission for that would be moreso - sending your contact info and then Michelle getting in contact to set something up
            rather than someone writing their story and submitting it.
